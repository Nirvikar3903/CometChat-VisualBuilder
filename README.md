CometChat Visual Builder Feedback
Building a chat application using CometChat’s Visual Builder was a smooth and beginner-friendly experience. As a low-code platform, it truly lives up to its goal of simplifying chat integration. The intuitive interface, paired with well-organized documentation, made it easy to go from zero to a working chat app without writing much code. It’s a great option for developers who want to get up and running quickly without reinventing the wheel.

## Key Steps and Highlights
- **1.Getting Started with Clear Docs**
-I started by going through CometChat’s official documentation, which has everything stated out clearly. It was well-structured and helped me understand the flow of using the Visual Builder without any guesswork.

- **2. Visual Builder – A Time Saver**
-The builder itself was a major win. It’s like a plug-and-play interface where you can drag and toggle chat features like user lists, message windows, etc. It removes a lot of complexity from the setup process 

- **3. Feature Toggling Made Simple**
-I loved how you can enable or disable specific components with just a switch — no need to touch any code. This gives you granular control over what shows up in your chat UI right from the start.

- **4. Video Walkthroughs That Actually Help**
-The YouTube guide linked in their docs was super handy. It made the setup feel much less intimidating and showed exactly how to go from builder to running app step-by-step.

-**5. Ready-to-Use UI Kit (No Extra Coding Needed Unless You Want It)** -
-we really don’t have to build anything from scratch unless you want to go beyond the defaults. The builder does all the heavy lifting — layout, logic, styling — and hands you ready-made code.

-**6.Smooth Integration with Vite**
-After generating the UI kit, I spun up a new React app with Vite and dropped the components in. Everything just worked. No additional setup was required, which was honestly refreshing.

## Drawbacks and Areas for Improvement**
**1. Mic Popup Behavior Needs Fixing** -
When clicking the mic button, a popup appears — which is great , but clicking anywhere outside doesn’t close it. That’s a basic interaction pattern users expect in modern apps, and it feels like a missing polish point in an otherwise sleek setup.

**2.UI Responsiveness Issue** -
On a common laptop screen size (around 1536×730), the chat layout doesn't fit properly.
Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars appear even when there’s no actual content overflow, making the interface feel less polished.
Suggestion: Adjust the layout to fit typical viewport sizes better — maybe using max-width: 100% / max-height: 100% or media queries to prevent unnecessary scrollbars.

**3. Limited Component Flexibility** -
The prebuilt components are helpful, but they’re also somewhat rigid. If you want to go beyond the default layout — like adding embedded features or third-party widgets — you’ll need to dive into the code and customize things manually.

**4. No Backend Integration Options** -
In the Visual builder theres no direct configured backend logics
While the builder handles frontend setup beautifully it doesn’t offer any way to visually link backend logic — like custom APIs, authentication flows, or database triggers. 

**5. Customization Limitations Within Builder** -
If you're aiming for a more tailored or branded experience, the Visual Builder might fall short. Deep customizations aren’t possible through the interface alone — you’ll need to tweak the exported code manually.
